# osTicket Public Roadmap

In this repository, you can find the [official osTicket public roadmap](https://github.com/osticket/roadmap/projects/1). Learn about what features we're working on, what stage they're in, and when we expect to have them available. Have any questions or comments about items on the roadmap? Join the discussion over on the [osTicket Community Forum](https://forum.osticket.com/).

The roadmap repository is for communicating osTicket’s roadmap. Issues are currrently limited to core collaborators only - with plans to open discussions to the public in the near future.

## Guide to the roadmap

Every item on the roadmap is an issue, with a label that indicates each of the following:

- A **release phase** that describes the next expected phase of the roadmap item. See below for a guide to [release phases](#Release phases).
- Once a feature is delivered, the **shipped** label will be applied to the roadmap issue and the issue will be closed with a comment linking to the relevant changelog.

## Release phases

Release phases indicate the stages that a feature goes through, from early testing to general availability.

- **alpha:** *Primarily for testing and feedback*\
Limited availability, features still under heavy development, and subject to change. Not for ready for production use

- **beta:** *Publicly available in full or limited capacity*\
Features mostly complete and documented. Timeline and requirements for GA usually published.

- **ga:** *Generally available to all users*\
Ready for production use and fully documented.

Some of the features may still be in the exploratory stages, and have no timeframe available. These are included in the roadmap only for early feedback. These are marked as follows:

- **in design:**\
Feature in discovery phase. Development is planned, but are still figuring out _how_.

- **exploring:**\
Feature under consideration. We are considering building this feature, and gathering feedback on it.

## Roadmap stages

The roadmap is arranged on a project board to give a sense for how far out each item is on the horizon. Every product or feature is added to a particular project board column according to the quarter in which it is expected to ship next. Be sure to read the [disclaimer](#disclaimer) below since the roadmap is subject to change, especially further out on the timeline.  You'll also find an **Exploratory** column, which is used in conjunction with the **in design** and **exploring** release phase labels for when no timeframe is yet available.

## Disclaimer

Any statement in this repository that is not purely historical is considered a forward-looking statement. The forward-looking product roadmap does not represent a commitment, guarantee, obligation or promise to deliver any product or feature, or to deliver any product and feature by any particular date, and is intended to outline the general development plans.
