# osTicket Public Roadmap

In this repository, you can find the [official osTicket public roadmap](https://github.com/orgs/osTicket/projects/2). Learn about what features we're working on, what stage they're in, and when we expect to have them available. Have any questions or comments about items on the roadmap? Join the [discussion](https://github.com/osTicket/roadmap/discussions)!

The roadmap repository is for communicating osTicketâ€™s roadmap. Issues are currently limited to core collaborators only however, community feedback is welcomed in the roadmap [discussions](https://github.com/osTicket/roadmap/discussions).

## Guide to the roadmap

osTicket 2.0 is being developed in cycles where we have a set period of time to complete the assigned projects for each cycle. After each cycle, we will have a short cooldown phase to plan for the next cycle as well as address issues in the legacy codebase.

The roadmap is arranged on a project board to give a sense for how far out each item is on the horizon. Be sure to read the [disclaimer](#disclaimer) below since the roadmap is subject to change, especially further out on the timeline.

Every item on the roadmap is an issue that represents a project, with a status that tracks the progress of each project.

- A **phase** describes the status of the roadmap item's progress. See below for a guide to [phases](#roadmap-phases).
- Once a feature has been completed, it will move to the **Done** phase and the issue will be closed.
- Projects that were not completed within the set timeframe will be closed and moved back to the **Todo** phase for reevaluation and will become a project for a future cycle.

## Roadmap phases

Phases indicate the development stages that a feature goes through.

- **R&D:** *Feature for Upcoming Cycle*\
The feature is scheduled to be worked on in the next upcoming cycle. During this phase, the Assignee for the Issue is planning out how they will complete this project as well as the proposed Scope of the project.

- **Pitched:** *In Discussion With Developers*\
At this phase, the Assignee will present their proposed plan for completing the project to the other developers. Through this discussion, we will decide if any changes need to be made to the project plan.

- **Scope:** *Project Plan is Complete*\
In this phase, the project is completely scoped out with a clear game plan in place to be completed in the upcoming cycle.

- **Coding:** *Development In Progress*\
The development cycle is in progress, and the project is actively being worked on.

- **Review:** *Pull Requests Made*\
The assigned developer has completed the project and created a Pull Request to be reviewed, revised, and merged.

- **Done:** *All Pull Requests Merged*\
All relevant Pull Requests for this project have been merged and the feature is complete.

Features that are not currently part of a cycle will have a status of **Todo** or **Dreams**.

- **Todo:** *Features We Must Have*\
Issues in this category are features that are essential to the codebase that must be completed.

- **Dreams:** *New Features We Would Like to Have*\
This phase is for features we do not currently have that we would like to work on once we have completed all of the Todo's. Additionally, a developer may choose to work through one of these items during Cooldown phases.
